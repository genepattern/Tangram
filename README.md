\
The following repository is a GPU-enabled GenePattern module of [Tangram](https://github.com/broadinstitute/Tangram), a deep learning method for mapping sc/snRNA-seq data to various forms of spatial data collected from the same region. It was written in Python 3 and uses a Singularity image built from its [Docker counterpart](https://hub.docker.com/layers/omarhalawa/tangram/v1.3/images/sha256-77a432f4d5ebe023e0ed073cb945600dd2f316e14b20aa27cc1f4077cf88f840?context=repo). 

Documentation on usage and implementation is found [here](/docs/documentation.md).
All source files, including input and output datasets for replicating runs from the original tutorial notebooks ([tutorial_tangram_with_squidpy.ipynb](https://github.com/broadinstitute/Tangram/blob/master/tutorial_tangram_with_squidpy.ipynb) & [tutorial_tangram_without_squidpy.ipynb](https://github.com/broadinstitute/Tangram/blob/master/tutorial_tangram_without_squidpy.ipynb)), can be found [here]().   

The original publication for the Tangram method can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01264-7).
